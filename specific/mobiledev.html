                    Hungry is an adaptive restaurant reccomender mobile application, created in Flutter and Dart. Hungry takes several aspects of user information, including price range, traveling distance, and cuisine type into account before ranking nearby reccomendations.
                    
                    Expense Manager is an expense tracker for college students. It informs users of their top categories and top keywords, so they know what types of purchases they're making.</p>
